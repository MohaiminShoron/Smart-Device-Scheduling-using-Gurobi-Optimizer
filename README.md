# Smart-Device-Scheduling-using-Gurobi-Optimizer
### Optimizing home appliance usage using a smart schedule made with Mixed-Integer Programming and Gurobi Optimizer
The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation was utilized to develop appliance schedules which was done by using Python and the Gurobi optimization solver. This model accounts for solar energy generation, aiming to maximize its use while adhering to appliance usage preferences. The modelâ€™s effectiveness is ensured by its comprehensive approach, integrating various constraints and variables specific to residential energy consumption patterns.
